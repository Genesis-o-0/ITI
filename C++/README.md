## Overview
Welcome to the C++ Fundamentals Projects Repository! This repository is dedicated to showcasing the projects I am working on during my time at the Information Technology Institute (ITI). As a passionate learner of C++ programming, I am excited to explore the language's fundamentals and demonstrate my progress through various small to medium console-based projects.

## Contribution
While this repository mainly represents my personal learning journey, I welcome any constructive feedback, suggestions, or contributions from the community. If you find any issues with the code or have ideas for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's learn together and make this repository a valuable resource for everyone interested in C++!
